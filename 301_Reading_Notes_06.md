### Reading [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

- What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

From the reading:
  Greater Efficiency
  Engaged Collaboration
  Learning From Fellow Students
  Social Skills
  Job Interview Readiness
  Work Environment Readiness

- In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

  In my experience, engaged collaboration and learning from fellow students were the two things I find most beneficial when I pair program. I have done it a lot, and most of the time I really love it. There's a certain kind of energy that comes from working closely with someone to solve a problem that I really love. The key to doing it well, in my opinion is to continute to work, even if you're confused, even if you don't feel like you have a lot to offer, it's suprising to me how much I know, and how much I learn, every time I pair program. So I really look forward to doing it whenever I can.

- How does pair programming work?
  In theory one person is the driver and the other is the navigator. The driver types in all of the code, and the navigator tells the driver what to type. In practice, pair programming tends to be a lot more fluid than that. The driver will have ideas that they share with the navigator and can influence the direction that the code takes with their input, while the navigator is also paying a lot of attention to what's being typed and is likely to catch both typos and syntax errors in the moment. Done well, pair programming creates a synergy that draws on the best of both members of the team. Done poorly, it's like fingernails on a chalkboard.
