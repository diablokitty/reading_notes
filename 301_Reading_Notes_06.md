# Reading Notes for Day 6 of 301:

## Readings: NODE.JS (And some other stuff.)

### Reading [An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

- What is node.js?

It's a javascript compile and execution package, essentially.

- In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

V8 is a compiler. It takes code and translates it into something your computer can use.

- What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

It's sort of an incubator environment where Javascript is compiled and run.

- What is npm?

node package manager - it's an installer for bits of code.

- What version of node are you running on your machine?

18.5.0

- What version of npm are you running on your machine?

8.12.1

- What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

npm i jshint

- What is node used for?

node is used to create an independent environment for Javascript to execute in, outside of a browser.

### Reading [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

- What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

From the reading:
  Greater Efficiency
  Engaged Collaboration
  Learning From Fellow Students
  Social Skills
  Job Interview Readiness
  Work Environment Readiness

- In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

  In my experience, engaged collaboration and learning from fellow students were the two things I find most beneficial when I pair program. I have done it a lot, and most of the time I really love it. There's a certain kind of energy that comes from working closely with someone to solve a problem that I really love. The key to doing it well, in my opinion is to continute to work, even if you're confused, even if you don't feel like you have a lot to offer, it's suprising to me how much I know, and how much I learn, every time I pair program. So I really look forward to doing it whenever I can.

- How does pair programming work?
  In theory one person is the driver and the other is the navigator. The driver types in all of the code, and the navigator tells the driver what to type. In practice, pair programming tends to be a lot more fluid than that. The driver will have ideas that they share with the navigator and can influence the direction that the code takes with their input, while the navigator is also paying a lot of attention to what's being typed and is likely to catch both typos and syntax errors in the moment. Done well, pair programming creates a synergy that draws on the best of both members of the team. Done poorly, it's like fingernails on a chalkboard.

## Things I want to know more about:

I kind of know what a runtime is, but I don't really know exactly what's happening in there, so tha's an area to explore.
