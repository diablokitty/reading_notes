## Intro to JWT

- What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?
- When should we use JSON Web Tokens?
- Claims are expected in which structural component of a JWT?
- Are JWTs Secure? 
Not really.

- If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure? 
We don't.

If sending a JWT, what must sender and receiver both know? Hint, itâ€™s appended in the signature.

Explain how concatenated content and secret can be sent and received securely to a non-technical recruiter.
