# Reading Notes for Day 43 of 401:

Open source projects are a great way to build a portfolio, learn about different ways that code is being used, and get to know others who are using the language you are learning to develop in. Before you begin to work on an open source project, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the project, what features have already been developed, and the way that the originators want you to submit your contributions. Open source contributions are great portfolio builders, and working with open source teams will help you to understand how to develop in concert with others. 

## These articles will help you learn more about open-source contributions.
