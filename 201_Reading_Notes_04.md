# Reading Notes for Day 4 of 201:

### Read Learn HTML Creating Hyperlinks

- To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

An 'a' tag.

- The href attribute contains what information?

The target address for the link; this can be an internal address or an external URL.

- What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

Use short, clear descriptive wording for the link title, don't use the actual URL, don't say 'link' and don't use the same text over and over (like 'click here').


### Read CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

- What is meant by “normal flow”?

The way that items on a page will position themselves without positioning interference.

- What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

Block level elements take up the width of the page by default and stack on other block level elements. Inline elements share the same line and overflow onto the next available line.

- ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

Static

- Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

Absolute positioning allows us to create isolated user interface features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. It also helps to conserve space on the page by existing outside the normal flow of items, and can draw emphasis to important page functions.

- What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

Per the reading "Absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one),  and fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport." (There are exceptions.)

### Read Learn JS Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

- Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

A function declaration is the instructions for what a function is supposed to do, and an invocation is the request for the function to do the thing. (Declaring is writing the spell, and invoking is casting the spell.)

- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

They're the same thing.


### Miscellaneous additional reading - 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

Greater effiency - I really like having someone there to catch my missed punctuation in the moment so I don't have to spend two hours wondering what's wrong with my code because I missed a closing parenthesis. And I feel good about being able to return the favor.

Learning from fellow students - so I always think of the saying "if you can't explain it, you don't know it. Paired programming gives opportunities to share information, help others develop skills, help identify areas of weakness for further personal study, and benefit from the knowledge of peers.



## Things I want to know more about

I probably understood about half of the CSS information on positioning, so I'll be looking for other sources to help me fully absorb the usefulness of that information, before I pretty much ignore it and build a bunch of ugly blocky websites that make graphic designers want to scream into the existential void. But functions are sexy.
