# Reading Notes: Trees

##Types of Trees:

Binary trees, binary search trees and k-ary trees.

- K-ary trees are trees with multiple notes.

## Common Terminology:

- Node: tree componentes that contain values and possible references to other nodes.

- Root: Root is the node at the start of the tree.

- K: a value that determines how many children a node can have in any given tree.

- Left/Right: directions that allows us to traverse nodes in binary trees. In k-ary trees this is replaced by 'index'.

- Edge: the link between the parent and the child node.

- Leaf: a node with no children.

- Height: the height of the tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf.

## Traversing Trees

### Breadth First

The breadth first method traverses across nodes at the same depth before moving to the next level.

### Depth First

The depth first method traverses to the end leaf of each leg of the tree before traversing the next leg. This is the more common way of traversing trees.
