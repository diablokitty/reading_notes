# Reading notes for day 7 of 201

### Domain Modeling

- Explain why we need domain modeling.

It helps us to have a common vocabulary and understanding for a project. With a good domain model, everyone knows what to expect and there are no misunderstandings or surprises.

### HTML Table Basics

- Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

 Because we have CSS for that now, and tables are clunky. (They reduce accessibility, produce 'tag soup' and are not automatically responsive.)

List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.

tbody - defines the body of a table.
tr - defines a row.
td - defines the data that will be in each cell of the row.

## Introducing Constructors

- What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

A constructor is a factory that is ued to create objects.

How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

When this is used in an object literal it's identifying information that's already been assigned, when it's used in a constructor it's assigning the information.

- Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

- Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

Prototypes are new properties of objects. I can't do this analogy, because I don't understand them well enough yet.

NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question
