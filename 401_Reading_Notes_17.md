It's when your application lives in the cloud instead of on a local server. 

## CDN

From the Cyperhoot website: 
  
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

Seamlessly. The website visitor doesn't know that there are multiple servers that could potentially be sending the requested information.
