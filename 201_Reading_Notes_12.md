# Reading Notes for Day 12 of 201:

### Reading JavaScript Canvas

- What does the < canvas > element allow a developer to acheive?
It allows the developer to draw 2D graphics with JavaScript using the element tag as a placeholder for rendering.

- What is the importance of the closing `< /canvas > tag?

It allows for placement of fallback content if the canvas element isn't supported by the client browser.

- Explain what the getContext() method does.

 getContext() takes one argument which is the type of context. For example, you use the "2d" to get a 2D rendering context object.

### Chart.js Documentation

- What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?

Chart.js is a library that allows you to draw a chart using the canvas tag. You have to port the files to either local storage or your GitHub repository, and then integrate them in your project.

- List 3 different Chart types you can create using Chart.js.

  1. Bar Chart
  2. Bubble Chart
  3. Line Chart

But honestly there are a lot of chart types. It's a very robust library.

### Easily Create Stunning Animated Charts with Chart.js

- What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?

Charts give you the option to display data in the way that it's most easily understood, or has great visual impact. Also lots of tables is boring.

- How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?

Adding charts might make the data easier to understand and more visually appealing to viewers.
