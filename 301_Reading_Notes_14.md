# Reading Notes for Day 14 of 301:

## Special Topic: Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

### Reading - Consider the history: [That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
There are several things that happened, but the article talks about the advent of home computing equipment (and tangentially home components like the Sega and Atari systems). These things were marketed to males.

Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

It meant that men who started CS programs had a major head start because they were familiar with computers and prosssibly also basic programming.
