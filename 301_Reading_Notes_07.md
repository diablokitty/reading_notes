## [Reading What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team]{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html}

This is a really fascinating article. I shared my thoughts about it [here](./201_Reading_Notes_14b.md).

## Reading [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

- Who is Roy Fielding?

A smart guy who did some fancy stuff for the internet to work (he was a principal architect of HTTP, FFS!).


- Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

There are too many different protocols. Essentially the computers speak different languages. 

- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

"A general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns." What does this mean? I think HTTP is a translator.

- What does a GET do?

Goes and gets something.

- What does a POST do?

Adds something to something.

- What does PUT do?

Replaces something.

- What does PATCH do?

Yeah, that's a good question. It's supposed to make a partial change, but it's quirky.

- API Keys

## Request a personal API key from the following APIs. You should receive these in your email within a few hours, often within minutes. Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment. Note: do not post your API keys in the Canvas discussion or on GitHub. Save them in a secure place.

### Geocoding API
- Did you get your API key?

Yes

### Weather Bit API
- Did you get your API key?

Yes.

### Yelp API Docs
- Did you get your API key?

I don't really know what's going on with this site. I got an API key, but it seems to think I'm developing something that should go in a directory. I'm thinking maybe not.

### The Movie DB API Docs
-Did you get your API key?

Yes.

## Things I want to know more about:

Why is my server refusing to display on the browser? And who do I sacrifice a chicken and three goats to to remove this 'blessing' of always finding the weird bugs?
