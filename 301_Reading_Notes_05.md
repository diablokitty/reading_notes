# Reading Notes for Day 5 of 301:

## Readings: Putting it all together (End of Week 1, Whew!)

### Reading [React Docs - Thinking in React]()

- What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
- What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
- Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
- What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
- How can you identify where state needs to live?

### Reading [Higher-Order Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK)

- What is a “higher-order function”?

  Functions that operate on other functions, by either taking them in as arguments (and so effectively calling them to get data) or by returning them (so they are being called as a part of the function, and then the data they produce is being returned for use somewhere else).

- Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

- Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.

### No addtional readings for today.
