### Read Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

Because the web is stateless, but sometimes you want to store information, and you don't want to use a server, so it's useful to be able to just stash it client-side.

What information should not be stored in local storage?

Nothing sensitive or that could be malicious.

Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

All strings, a bunch of strings. Not sure if you're looking for 'set item' as the way to convert it? You use that command to store the information.
