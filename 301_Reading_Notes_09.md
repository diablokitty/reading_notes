# Reading Notes for Day 9 of 301:

## Readings: Functional Programming

### Reading [Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

- What is functional programming?

From the reading and Wikipedia - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

From the reading: 
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects

- What is immutability?

A characteric of not changing.

- What is Referential transparency?

From the reading: Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

Essentially a function that gives consistent results.

### Video [Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHLd36QoS4k)

- What is a module?

It's a segment of code that has a certain specific functionality, that is segregated into it's own file.

- What does the word ‘require’ do?

It imports external files and libraries into our files when we are using Express.

- How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

We require it.

- What do we have to do to make a module available?
We have to require it and then make it available for use.


## Things I want to know more about:

I'm pretty good, or totally confused, not sure.
