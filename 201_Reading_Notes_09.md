# Reading Notes for Day 9 of 201:

### Reading HTML Forms, Your first Web Form. How To Structure A Web Form.

 - Why are forms so important in web development?

Because they are a way for a user to interact with a website, and for the owner of the site to do things like gather information from visitors.

- When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

Users need to be able to understand what they're supposed to do with the form, so you should lay forms out in a logical order, make buttons visible and easy to understand, and choose fonts and colors that are very readable.

- List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

Label <label> Tells the user what to do (like answer a question or enter information)
Input <input> defines what kind of input we expect (like email)
Textarea <textarea> allows a user to enter a short text response in a multi-line field.
Button <button>Click</button> is how the user transmits the finished form (via an event listener on the button, but that's later)
<form>Form goes here</form> defines the area of the website where these other interactive elements will reside.
(apparently MarkDown responds to some of these tags.)
### Read Learn JS Introduction To Events.

- How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

Events are when something happens on a website, usually because the user does a thing like presses a button.

- When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
The name of the event and a function to handle the event (code that does something when the event signal is given).

- Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
The event object is a parameter specified with a name such as event, evt, or e. It is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information. It's useful because it specifies where the event is happening and saves us some coding work.


- What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing? 
Event bubbling checks elements from the event outward, event capturing starts outward and works inward.


## Further reading HTML5 Input Types and Event Reference and listings

## Things I want to know more about

All things taking input and giving back stimulation are cool. I want to know more about how to take in data and do all the stuff with it.
